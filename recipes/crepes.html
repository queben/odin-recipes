        <h2>Crepes are super simple to make yet add so much joy to your meal.</h2>

        <p>Most, if not all of these ingredients you should already have on hand.
            Easily dress up your crepes for any flavor you'd like.
        </p>

        <h1>Ingredients</h1>

        <ul>
            <li>1 cup all purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>1/2 cup milk</li>
            <li>1/2 cup water</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Steps</h1>

        <ol>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour and the eggs.
                Gradually add in the milk and water, stirring to combine. Add
                the salt and butter; beat until smooth.
            </li>
            <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium high heat.
                Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4
                cup for each crepe. Tilt the pan with a circular motion so that the
                batter coats the surface evenly.
            </li>
            <li>Cook the crepe for about 2 minutes, until the bottom is light brown.
                Loosen with a spatula, turn and cook the other side. Serve hot.
            </li>
        </ol>
