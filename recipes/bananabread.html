        <h1>Ingredients</h1>
        
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>1/4  teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/2 cup butter</li>
            <li>3/4 cup brown sugar</li>
            <li>2 eggs, beaten</li>
            <li>2 1/3 cups mashed overripe bananas</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Steps</h1>

        <ol>
            <li>Prehead oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a
                9x5 inch loaf pan.
            </li>
            <li>In a large bowl, combine flour, baking soda and salt. In a
                separate bowl, cream together butter and brown sugar. Stir in
                eggs and mashed bananas until well blended. Stir banana mixture
                into flour mixture; stir just to moisten. Pour batter into prepared
                loaf pan.
            </li>
            <li>Bake in preheated oven for 60 to 65 minutes, until a toothpick inserted
                into center of the loaf comes out clean. Let bread cool in pan for 10
                minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack.
            </li>
        </ol>
